After gone through algorithm 40 lessons and took offline algorithm boot camp, I can see my growth significantly.
Compare to fear to most of medium and hard problems in leetcode half years ago, I can figure out the solution for
for more and more problems (even hard ones). I believe the next stage is large number of deliberate practices to
improve my speed and proficiency. I need also read more articles to understand the real use cases of data structure and 
algorithms in modern famous open source software/libraries.
